# 1.5 Setting up the Development Environment

![NPM vs Yarn vs PNPM](NPM vs Yarn vs PNPM.png)

For as long as Node has existed, or should we say as long as these package-managers have existed — `NPM`; `Yarn`; `PNPM` — there has been an ongoing dispute in the developer community about which of these is best.

**1. NPM** :
(Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js and has the largest repository of packages. Below, the NPM basic commands

**2. Yarn** : 
(Yet Another Resource Negotiator) was created by Facebook as an alternative to npm with improved performance and security features.
You can install Yarn using npm ;-) 

**3. PNPM** :
(performant NPM), a fast, disk space efficient package manager. Is focused on performance and efficiency and is designed to save disk space.
