# 15. Advanced State Management with Zustand

![zustand.png](zustand.png)

A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state management solution. Zustand has a comfy API based on hooks. It isn't boilerplatey or opinionated, but has enough convention to be explicit and flux-like.

Don't disregard it because it's cute, it has claws! Lots of time was spent to deal with common pitfalls, like the dreaded zombie child problem, React concurrency, and context loss between mixed renderers. It may be the one state manager in the React space that gets all of these right.

Sure! Let’s dive into **Zustand** with **React** and **TypeScript**, step-by-step, just like we did with **Redux**.

### What is **Zustand**?
**Zustand** is a lightweight and fast state management library for React, similar to Redux but simpler to use. It's perfect for projects where you want to avoid the complexity of Redux Toolkit or don't need the full Redux ecosystem.

### Setting Up a Project with **Zustand** and **TypeScript**

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Project

1. **Initialize a new React project using Vite** (or any other method like CRA). Here’s how to do it with **Vite** for TypeScript:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest zustand-ts-app -- --template react-ts
   cd zustand-ts-app
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install Zustand**:

   ```bash
   npm install zustand
   ```
