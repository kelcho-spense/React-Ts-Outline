## 2. Calculator
A simple to use calculator with an appealing user interface. A virtual calculator built with React is another good project idea for you to try as a beginner. 

We have seen various calculator apps on our mobile phones, computers and different devices as well. Here we have an input box which takes user input as numbers and then try to do operations like addition, subtraction, division and multiplication etc. Here we will learn to create a web app with all the features of the calculator on UI.

 ## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
